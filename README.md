# Final Project Celerates Acceleration Program - Data Science Basics

## Project Description

In this Final Project, participants are provided with case studies from various pre-provided datasets. Participants can choose one of the three given data cases. The final project is conducted in groups with 4-5 members per group. Participants will carry out an end-to-end process on the given data, including analysis, modeling, and optionally creating a dashboard, as well as writing a report on the final project.

## Objective
To create a report on a technical data science project based on the given case study.

## Data Source

The dataset consists of various data cases (Time Series Forecasting, Regression, and Classification)

1. Time Series Forecasting

In the Time Series Forecasting case, participants will predict future data values based on the historical data provided.

2. Regression

In the Regression case, participants will estimate the value of a target/label (which is continuous) based on other variables that influence the target/label.

3. Classification

In the Classification case, participants will build a model that can categorize data according to the class labels specified in the provided datasets. The labels in the Classification case are discrete.

## About Dataset

Source: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/employee-dataset)

#### Context:

This dataset contains information about employees in a company, including their educational backgrounds, work history, demographics, and employment-related factors. It has been anonymized to protect privacy while still providing valuable insights into the workforce.

#### Columns:
- Education: The educational qualifications of employees, including degree, institution, and field of study.
- Joining Year: The year each employee joined the company, indicating their length of service.
- City: The location or city where each employee is based or works.
- Payment Tier: Categorization of employees into different salary tiers.
- Age: The age of each employee, providing demographic insights.
- Gender: Gender identity of employees, promoting diversity analysis.
- Ever Benched: Indicates if an employee has ever been temporarily without assigned work.
- Experience in Current Domain: The number of years of experience employees have in their current field.

## Assessment Parameters

- Participants can describe and understand the data well.
- Identify appropriate data processing techniques according to the topic and data type.
- Perform analysis that can observe data patterns and other insights to better understand data characteristics.
- Train machine learning or deep learning models according to the case and type of data being processed.
- Optimize the model using appropriate techniques.
- Understand the most suitable evaluation metrics and explain them well based on the model's performance.
- Write a clear, objective report based on the experiments conducted. Additional visualizations, such as dashboards or products, will add extra value for participants.
- Leave or Not: a target column
- Make one or more classification models with Leave or Not column as a target column. Use proper evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
